	cute_path.h - v1.01

	To create implementation (the function definitions)
		#define CUTE_PATH_IMPLEMENTATION
	in *one* C/CPP file (translation unit) that includes this file

	SUMMARY:

		Collection of c-string manipulation functions for dealing with common file-path
		operations. More or less a less-fully-featured replacement for Shlwapi.h path
		functions on Windows.

		Performs no dynamic memory management and has no external dependencies (other than
		some crt funcs).

	Revision history:
		1.0  (11/01/2017) initial release
		1.01 (11/10/2017) path_compact, path_pop bugfixes
